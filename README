*************
Overview
*************

This project is a carousel display in jQuery.  A scroll bar is
possible but disabled in CSS.  Settings such as speed and scroll 
frequency can be changed using data attributes.

*************
Usage
*************

This project consists of the carousel itself, an svg indicator 
to help with navigation, and left/right buttons.  The last two 
are optional, so let's start with setting up the basic carousel
by itself.  Be sure to check out the live demo (link at the top) 
to see all of this in action.

The carousel itself is just your content, a container div, and a
window div.  The window div has the class "imagebar_window", and
any content below it is visible while other content is hidden.
The two important CSS properties here are white-space: nowrap;
and overflow: hidden;.  Other than that, just set this up where
you want your carousel content to appear.

The container div has the class "imagebar_window_slides", and it
needs to contain all of your content horizontally from left to
right.  Give it the CSS property white-space: nowrap; as well,
and be sure to set the width to accomodate all of your content
without wrapping.

Each "slide" that will appear in the carousel should have the
class "imagebar_window_slide" and the id "imagebar_window_slide[n]"
where [n] should be replaced with the number slide, starting 
from zero.  These can be any block-level object, such as a div
or an img.  You might want to use float: left; on each of these
in order to keep them positioned right next to eachother.


<div class="imagebar_window">
	<div class="imagebar_window_slides">
		<img src="image1.jpg" class="imagebar_window_slide" id="imagebar_window_slide0">
		<img src="image2.jpg" class="imagebar_window_slide" id="imagebar_window_slide1">
		<img src="image3.jpg" class="imagebar_window_slide" id="imagebar_window_slide2">
	</div>
</div>
		

As mentioned, indicator circles can also be used to show 
which slide is currently active and its position among 
the total number of slides.  Just set a class of 
"imagebar_indicators_circle" and an id of
"imagebar_indicators_circle[n]", where [n] is the number
of the indicator starting from zero.  I used a simple SVG
indicator with an id of "imagebar_indicators" on the svg
object, though thumbnails or any other clickable object 
could also be used to scroll to a specific slide.


<svg id="imagebar_indicators" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1">
   	<circle class="imagebar_indicators_circle" id="imagebar_indicators_circle0" cx="126" cy="20" r="6" stroke="#afafaf" stroke-width="2" fill="#ffffff" />
   	<circle class="imagebar_indicators_circle" id="imagebar_indicators_circle1" cx="146" cy="20" r="6" stroke="#afafaf" stroke-width="2" fill="#ffffff" />
   	<circle class="imagebar_indicators_circle" id="imagebar_indicators_circle2" cx="166" cy="20" r="6" stroke="#afafaf" stroke-width="2" fill="#ffffff" />
</svg>


Lastly, to provide forward/back buttons, just add the
class "imagebar_button_left" or "imagebar_button_right"
to any clickable object and it will transition in
whichever direction you click.  It will correctly wrap
back around to the start/finish if you go too far.


<b class="imagebar_button_left">Left</b> | 
<b class="imagebar_button_right">Right</b>


*****************
Configuration
*****************

You can change the default transition speed, transition
frequency, and/or animation type by passing a simple
data attribute in the imagebar_window_slides div.

data-imagebar-speed = the duration of the transition, milliseconds
data-imagebar-frequency = the time between each transition, milliseconds 
data-imagebar-animation = "fade" will give a fading transition, othwerise scrolling is used
