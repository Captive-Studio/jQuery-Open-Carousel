Overview
*************

This creates an automatically scrolling div using JavaScript.  It also 
allows the use of forward and back scroll buttons.  A scroll bar is
possible but disabled in CSS.  Settings such as speed, scroll 
frequency, and width are accessible as settings in the JavaScript
file.

Usage
