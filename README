*************
Overview
*************

This project is an automatically scrolling div.  I wrote two 
examples, one using just JavaScript and one using jQuery.  Both
allow the use of forward and back scroll buttons.  A scroll bar is
possible but disabled in CSS.  Settings such as speed, scroll 
frequency, and width are accessible as settings in the js files.

Usage
*************

Feel free to use any of the code here however you like.  There is a lot
of potential to modify this project to your needs, so go for it!  I'd
appreciate credit if you think credit is due.
